# Train the Trainer Pretest

### Activity 2

The `self-assessment` branch has some issues and we want to get rid of it, but first let's rescue a couple of commits:

- Type `echo "starting activity 2"` on your command line.
- Create a new branch called `explain-git-github`
- Rescue the following commits from this branch and place them on your new branch:
 - `add prompt to explain git and github`
 - `add instructions for activity 2`
- Use the appropriate diff command to identify the new prompt in the `index.html` file
- Open the `index.html` and respond to the prompts that have been added.
- Amend the commit so that all of these changes appear to be a single commit.
- Merge this branch with `master`, resolving any conflicts (keep the changes on your branch and discard those on master).
- Add a tag marking this point in time as v1.0
- When you are finished with the above, create a branch from the v0.1 tag to find Activity 3.


### Reminders

- These activities use both GitHub.com and Git. Complete as many of the tasks locally as possible.
- The last activity will require you to paste your command line history for the entire activity.
