# Train the Trainer Post-test

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the post-test for the _GitHub for Developers Train the Trainer_ course.

The goal of this post-test is to help us evaluate whether the GitHub for Developers Train the Trainer has helped you to advance and refine your Git and GitHub skills. 

### General Instructions

- The README.md will always contain the instructions for the current task. As you complete each activity, the README will change so remember to keep looking here for instructions!
- These activities use both GitHub.com and Git. Complete as many of the tasks locally as possible.
- The last activity will require you to paste your command line history for the entire activity. **If you want to make life easier, now would be a good time to run `history -c` and clear out your history file.**

### Getting Started

- Start by typing `echo "starting activity 1"` on your command line.
- Find the commit `replace activity 1 instructions`. Revert this commit and come back to the README for further instructions.
