# Train the Trainer Post-test

### Activity 3

You are almost done! Just a few more steps to complete:

- Type `echo "starting activity 3"` on your command line.
- Remove the text in the current readme and replace it with two sections:
 - `## Need More Info` Followed by a list of the things you still found difficult or confusing as you completed this post-test _(remember this repository is private so only you and your trainer will see this list)_.
- `## Feedback for the Future` Followed by any feedback you have on how we can improve the Train-the-Trainer course in the future.
- Commit each section separately.
- Now use the appropriate command to turn these in to a single commit.
- Push your branch and create a pull request.
- Run the `history` command in your terminal and copy/paste your history for the entire post-test into the Pull Request comment.

### Reminders

- These activities use both GitHub.com and Git. Complete as many of the tasks locally as possible.
- The last activity will require you to paste your command line history for the entire activity.
